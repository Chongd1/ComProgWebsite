                <h3>Synopsis: </h3>
                <p>The smart, sophisticated, and breathtakingly beautiful half-Japanese, half-Russian Alisa Mikhailovna Kujou is regarded as her school's idol. She has won the hearts of many male classmates with her long silver hair, captivating blue eyes, and unusually fair complexion. She is also greatly loved by everyone else. Even still, everyone is still cautious about the almost gorgeous girl because of her somewhat distant demeanor. Masachika Kuze, Alisa's benchmate, is one of the few exceptions. He's a pretty normal boy who passes his days playing gacha games and watching anime. Masachika is the only student that gets Alisa's attention, despite his casual manner. Because she can't be really honest, Alisa usually treats Masachika harshly and only shows her love in Russian. She doesn't realize, though, that Masachika is genuinely fluent in the language; he's just playing pretend. The strange couple's connection progressively becomes more romantic and enjoyable as they continue to exchange clever and lighthearted remarks; perhaps even more importantly, Alisa may finally learn to express her own sentiments without fear.</p>
