Pilots produced inside Plantation live in Mistilteinn, also know as the "birdcage." Children live there knowing nothing of the outside world or the freedom of the sky. Their lives consist of battling to carry out missions. Their enemies are mysterious giant lifeforms known as Kyōryū, and the children pilot robots called Franxx to face off against them. For the children, riding the Franxx proves their existence. A boy named Hiro is called Code:016, and he was once known as a prodigy. However, he has fallen behind, and his existence seems unnecessary. Not piloting a Franxx is the same as ceasing to exist. One day, a mysterious girl known as "Zero Two" appears before him. Two horns grow out of her head.</p>

In the midst of a casual encounter with his colleague, he falls victim to a random assailant on the streets and is stabbed. However, while succumbing to his injuries, a peculiar voice echoes in his mind, and recites a bunch of commands which the dying man cannot make sense of.


When Satoru regains consciousness, he discovers that he has reincarnated as a goop of slime in an unfamiliar realm. In doing so, he acquires newfound skills—notably, the power to devour anything and mimic its appearance and abilities. He then stumbles upon the sealed Catastrophe-level monster "Storm Dragon" Veldora who had been sealed away for the past 300 years for devastating a town to ashes. Sympathetic to his predicament, Satoru befriends him, promising to assist in destroying the seal. In return, Veldora bestows upon him the name Rimuru Tempest to grant him divine protection.


Now, liberated from the mundanities of his past life, Rimuru embarks on a fresh journey with a distinct goal in mind. As he grows accustomed to his new physique, his gooey antics ripple throughout the world, gradually altering his fate.

Souta Mizushino is a high school student who aspires to be such a creator by writing and illustrating his own light novel. One day, while watching anime for inspiration, he is briefly transported into a fierce fight scene. When he returns to the real world, he realizes something is amiss: the anime's headstrong heroine, Selesia Yupitilia, has somehow returned with him.


Before long, other fictional characters appear in the world, carrying the hopes and scars of their home. A princely knight, a magical girl, a ruthless brawler, and many others now crowd the streets of Japan. However, the most mysterious one is a woman in full military regalia, dubbed "Gunpuku no Himegimi," who knows far more than she should about the creators' world. Despite this, no one knows her true name or the world she is from.


Meanwhile, Souta and Selesia work together with Meteora Österreich, a calm and composed librarian NPC, to uncover the meaning behind these unnatural events. With powerful forces at play, the once clear line between reality and imagination continues to blur, leading to a fateful meeting between creators and those they created.

She has won the hearts of many male classmates with her long silver hair, captivating blue eyes, and unusually fair complexion. She is also greatly loved by everyone else. Even still, everyone is still cautious about the almost gorgeous girl because of her somewhat distant demeanor. Masachika Kuze, Alisa's benchmate, is one of the few exceptions. He's a pretty normal boy who passes his days playing gacha games and watching anime. Masachika is the only student that gets Alisa's attention, despite his casual manner. Because she can't be really honest, Alisa usually treats Masachika harshly and only shows her love in Russian. She doesn't realize, though, that Masachika is genuinely fluent in the language; he's just playing pretend. The strange couple's connection progressively becomes more romantic and enjoyable as they continue to exchange clever and lighthearted remarks; perhaps even more importantly, Alisa may finally learn to express her own sentiments without fear.</p>

                <h3>Synopsis: </h3>
                <p>As portals to an alternate world called the "Mato" appear all across Japan, a new resource called "Peaches" is found that grants special skills to women alone. But there are also terrible monsters known as "Yomotsu Shuuki" who prowl the Mato and have caused a number of disasters in the past. The government created the Anti-demon Corps, an elite force of female
warriors endowed with authority by the Peaches, to fight them. A high school student called Yuuki Wakura was unexpectedly lost at a Mato entryway one day as he was making his way home from school. The head of the Seventh Unit of the Anti-demon Corps, Kyouka Uzen, comes to his aid as soon as he asks for assistance. Acknowledging his potential and depending on him to enhance the effectiveness of her Peach power, she requests that Yuuki enlist in the Anti-demon Corps as her slave—a role he could find more pleasurable than he had anticipated.</p>
